This is a chatbot designed to respond to user input by searching for specific keywords and phrases and providing pre-determined responses.

This code defines a function called responderPregunta that takes an input text as an argument. It then processes the input text by searching for specific keywords and phrases within it, using a set of dictionaries (dictFirstLayer, dictSecondLayerCarreras, dictThirdLayerCarreras, dictFourthLayerMaterias, dictFifthLayerProfesores, dictSecondLayerBecas, dictSecondLayerCampus, dictSecondLayerInscripciones, dictSecondLayerColegiaturas, and dictSecondLayerServicios) that contain possible responses to those keywords and phrases.

If a match is found, the corresponding response is printed to the console and the function returns. If no match is found, a default message is printed indicating that the information was not found and the function returns.

The global context variable is used to store information from previous interactions, which is appended to the input text to provide additional context for the keyword search.
